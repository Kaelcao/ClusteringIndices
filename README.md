# Clustering Indices

This work was done during an internship (2016) at Computer Science Laboratory (Laboratoire d'Informatique de Paris Nord, LIPN)
at the University of Paris 13, with 
CAO Anh Quan (USTH, Vitenam)
supervized by  
LEBBAH Mustapha (LIPN, Paris 13 university), 
AZZAG Hanene (LIPN, Paris 13 university), 
DOAN Nhat Quang (USTH, Vietnam). 

The purpose of this program is to calculate the external and internal Indices 
using SPARK which is used to measure how good is the clustering algorithm (using labels with external indices). 
 This work is based on the Cluster Crit package in R
